# It's the future! Where are flying cars and laser guns?

Hades is an experimental project to create software that subverts how we see desktop software, and internet software.

Call it "art installation" or concept, discussion, brainfart or just the fact that I am fed up with trusting my data to third parties that one day might shut down, get inglobated and shut down or otherwise get walled off from the rest of the internet (and my devices).

## Hades Aims

- Your interaction is around places, channel and people

Currently desktop operating systems allow you to interact with files and applications.
What if instead we thought of desktop software as interacting with other people, channels and even places?

- Data migrates with you, and you can publish it easily to other people, if you wish

Today you use your phone like a cd. Lose your Beethoven cd? You need to get a new one. Lose all the data on your phone? Well you are S.O.L. since you need to recreate all your data on it. There should be a way to "just add water" (another device) and have stuff get backed up automatically.

- Turn desktop software into something awesome to use

## Hades Non-Aims

- Reinvent the wheel

If an use-case is already covered, I will try to not re-cover it.

- Invent new protocols

There are too many protocols already. This is project is to use

- Hide you from the rest of the internet

And for anonymity too. This system is for identity. You can use a pseudonym, but you have to roll out your security.

## How does HADES tries to accomplish its aims?

- One desktop application at a time
