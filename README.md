# It's the future! Where are flying cars and laser guns?

The early millenium was shaping up fine. People met on the internet, flamed on usenet, married in mmorpgs and shared stuff. Likes were exchanged in real life with real life beer. There was also drama, but drama was consumed in itself.

Then the web 2.0 came... and smartphones... and walled gardens, and appstores. And everything crumbled. 

## What we lost

1. They came for my usenet.

They saved e-mail by putting anti-spam systems, but nobody cared about saving usenet from itself. Unfortunately private e-mail nowadays is used to push registration links, password reset and SOLICITED commercial e-mail. A really big victory indeed.

2. Then they came for my status line.

Oh yes, a status line is an obnoxious feature. It removes space from the window for something I might change or not change for long stretches of time. The important thing is the green light and the little keyboard (or phone) icon that tells where I am. There may be a poop emoji, but there's no poop status icon.

3. In the end they removed my avatar. 

They forced the population to use their Real Names thinking they would not be so stupid to use it to spew hate. They were wrong. But that was not the point. The point of Real Names was to make internet users into sellable assets.

## However

The dirty truth of web 2.0 and commercial (appstore) software is that when a website or software disappears, your data disapppears, including the ways you consumed and transformed the internet with it.

# A modest proposal

Let's take back the internet step-by-step by taking back the computer desktop.
Let's take back the computer desktop by subverting what we think about how we use computers.

# What can we do.

1. Start a discussion about what desktop computing lacks or misses

And that absolutely does not mean toolkits, ides, editors or media players

2. Implement it

3. Have fun
