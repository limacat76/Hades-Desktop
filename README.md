# It's the future! Where are flying cars and laser guns?

Hades is an experimental project to create software that subverts how we see desktop software, and internet software.

Call it "art installation" or concept, discussion, brainfart or just the fact that I am fed up with trusting my data to third parties that one day might shut down, get inglobated and shut down or be otherwise get walled off.

## Hades Aims

- Your interaction is around places, channel and people

Currently desktops allow you to interact with files and applications.
What if instead we thought of desktop software as interacting with other people, channels and even places?

- Data migrates with you, and you can publish it easily to other people, if you wish

- Turn desktop software into something awesome to use

And for the destkop we mean applications that directly interact with people.

## Hades Non-Aims

- Reinvent the wheel

If an use-case is already covered, I will try to not re-cover it.
Proposing ides and text editors is explicitly forbidden.

- Invent new protocols

There are too many low level internet protocols already. We will try to reuse what it available already

- Hide you from the rest of the internet

Privacy comes from you using good practices with good tools. There are already many good tools to use for privacy.

## How does HADES tries to accomplish its aims?

- One desktop application at a time
